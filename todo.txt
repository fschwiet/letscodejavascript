query to load unread feeds 
  - queries RSS feed and write results to database
    -> store a hash of the url so we can index them
  - queries those results back from the database, filtering by user's read column
  

use npm module sha1 to build the hash  
  
feed results:
  - rssUrl
  - postName
  - postUrl
  - postDate
  - postUrlHash (40 characters)
  - rssUrlHash (40 characters)
  
  
read feeds:
  - userId
  - urlHash (40 characters)




GOAL:
    -> add jake task that verifies that hostname resolves to local machine (127.0.0.1)
      in error message, recommend the hosts file be modified.
      

  should have error logging when login fails using http://192.168.1.248 (hostname doesn't match configuration hostname)

  should track what feeds have already been read

  layout shouldn't be terrible

  should have better error output when migrations fail (when database not found)

  should have automated rollback

HMMM
    can I write a jade preprocessor for karma?
      https://gist.github.com/ryanfitz/834768
      https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/565    
      - canary build of karma may allow registering a preprocessor


    should I build runtime.js as part of the build in case jade is updated?
