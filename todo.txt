* TODOs
* how to verify uploads directory exists on deployment?


GOALS
- deploy to own server


tentative deployment plan

  * To check a commit is ready to deploy, from commit A to B, we verify database migrations and mark the commit in a special branch:
    1.  checkout into a new directory to B
    2.  npm build
    3.  write config file
    3.  create test database running migrations to B
    4.  checkout commit A
    5.  run integration tests.  (verifies the schema migrations won't break running code)
    5.  checkout commit B
    5.  run integration tests   (verifies integration tests)
    5.  migrate database backwards to A
    5.  checkout commit A
    5.  run integration tests   (verifies we can roll back)
    5.  migrate database forward to B
    5.  checkout commit B
    5.  run integration tests (verifies)
    6.  add a commit, included in special git branch.  Commit message should indicate the version tested against.
    *  Might need to enforce these same steps are taken for releases, 

  * To deploy a commit:
    1.  pull solution into a new directory
    2.  npm build
    3.  write config file
    3.  run database migrations (old code must work against new schema)
    4.  configure IIS to use that folder
