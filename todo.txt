have tests run server in-process, so user access can be intercepted
  -> server isn't shutting down cleanly when the login setup code is run ... maybe passport, passport-google are leaking a resource?


GOAL:
    -> add jake task that verifies that hostname resolves to local machine (127.0.0.1)
      in error message, recommend the hosts file be modified.
      

  should have error logging when login fails using http://192.168.1.248 (hostname doesn't match configuration hostname)

  should track what feeds have already been read

  layout shouldn't be terrible

  should have better error output when migrations fail (when database not found)

  should have automated rollback


TODO:

  

  - MySQL connection pooling?
      https://npmjs.org/package/mysql-simple
      - stale by 2 years
      https://npmjs.org/package/easy-mysql
      - stale by 6 months
      https://npmjs.org/package/mysql-connection-pool
      - stale by 6 months
      https://npmjs.org/package/node-mysql-pooled
      - stale by 8 months

  reduce personal information requested from google (only using email, displayName)
    
LATER:
    allow users to add a feed

    log at info level if an rss feed can't be loaded?  (maybe this should be a feed status)

    open an issue on iisnode because it was failing get requests with a content-type (node.js from the command-line was more graceful)

HMMM
    can I write a jade preprocessor for karma?
      https://gist.github.com/ryanfitz/834768
      https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/565    
      - canary build of karma may allow registering a preprocessor


    should I build runtime.js as part of the build in case jade is updated?


LESSONS LEARNED:
  
  Set SQL collation when you create a database.  The default probably isn't utf8.

  node-mysql will treat incoming dates as being in the local timezone, set the timezone to Z to disable that.
