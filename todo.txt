GOAL:
  should be able to read feeds

  should have error logging when login fails using http://192.168.1.248 (hostname doesn't match configuration hostname)

  should have better error output when migrations fail (when database not found)

  should have automated rollback


TODO:

  feeds should be inserted in order

  reader page
    - on page load, a list of feeds is rendered as a JSON object
    - client-side code takes the list, and for each makes a request to load feeds.
    - that feed goes to the server, which then returns however many feed items were found
      - the feed items contain a timestamp and html field
    - the client-side code inserts the results in order

  tests are failing because they're reusing the same user.  Have test delete the googleprofile/userid association to startup.

HMMM
    can I write a jade preprocessor for karma?
      https://gist.github.com/ryanfitz/834768
      https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/565    
      - canary build of karma may allow registering a preprocessor


    should I build runtime.js as part of the build in case jade is updated?
