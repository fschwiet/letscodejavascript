  should be able to read feeds

  should have error logging when login fails using http://192.168.1.248 (hostname doesn't match configuration hostname)

  should have better error output when migrations fail (when database not found)

  should have automated rollback


TODO:

  tests are failing because they're reusing the same user.  Have test delete the googleprofile/userid association to startup.
