  how to smoke test email settings?

  

  split phantom-shim to another project
    could get rid of phantom-shim's promisify if:
      - page.evaluate could be wrapped in a way that Q util functions can wrap that wrapper
      - Q handles inline exceptions as desired
      - onError can be monitored with before/after handling for each async call


  info notification on /feeds should have better layout

  should have a loading indicator

  should be able to subscribe to individual feeds

  should have post preview



GOAL:

  should have a way to kill karma server+client processes, use it for deployToIIS


    -> add jake task that verifies that hostname resolves to local machine (127.0.0.1)
      in error message, recommend the hosts file be modified.
      

  should have error logging when login fails using http://192.168.1.248 (hostname doesn't match configuration hostname)

  should have better error output when migrations fail (happened when database not found)

  should have automated rollback

  reduce personal information requested from google (only using email, displayName)
    
LATER:
    allow users to add a feed

    log at info level if an rss feed can't be loaded?  (maybe this should be a feed status)

    open an issue on iisnode because it was failing get requests with a content-type (node.js from the command-line was more graceful)


MUCH LATER:
    should I publish the jade preprocessor for karma?

    should I build runtime.js as part of the build in case jade is updated?


HMMM
    didn't catch bug with automated tests when request parameters used in client-side didn't match what was used in server-side tests
      end-to-end test for this functionality was being painful to write


SOME LESSONS LEARNED:
  
  Set SQL collation when you create a database.  The default probably isn't utf8.

  node-mysql will treat incoming dates as being in the local timezone, set the timezone to Z to disable that.
